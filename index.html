      <p>Robyn Rihanna Fenty was born on February 20, 1988, in Saint Michael, Barbados.[8] She is the daughter of accountant Monica (née Braithwaite) and warehouse supervisor Ronald Fenty.[9][10] Her mother is an Afro-Guyanese, while her father is a Barbadian of African, Irish, English, and Scottish descent.[11][12][13][14] Rihanna has two brothers, Rorrey and Rajad Fenty, and two half-sisters and a half-brother from her father's side, each born to different mothers from his previous relationships.[15][16] She grew up in a three-bedroom bungalow in Bridgetown and sold clothes with her father in a stall on the street. Her childhood was deeply affected by her father's alcoholism and crack cocaine addiction, which contributed to her parents' strained marriage. Rihanna's father used to abuse her mother physically, and Rihanna would try to get in between them to break up fights.[17]</p>
      <p>As a child, Rihanna had many CT scans for the excruciating headaches she suffered, recalling, "The doctors even thought it was a tumor, because it was that intense."[15] By the time she was 14, her parents had divorced, and her health began to improve.[10][18] She grew up listening to reggae music.[15][19] She attended Charles F. Broome Memorial Primary School and Combermere School, where she studied alongside future international cricketers Chris Jordan and Carlos Brathwaite.[20][15] As an 11-year-old, Rihanna was an army cadet in a sub-military programme, where the later Barbadian singer-songwriter Shontelle was her drill sergeant.[21][22] Although she initially wanted to graduate from high school, she chose to pursue a musical career instead.[23]</p>

      <p>In 2003, Rihanna formed a musical trio with two of her classmates in her home country of Barbados.[15] Without a name or any material, the girl group auditioned with American record producer Evan Rogers, who commented, "The minute Rihanna walked into the room, it was like the other two girls didn't exist."[15] Rihanna went to Rogers's hotel room, where she performed renditions of Destiny's Child's "Emotion" and Mariah Carey's "Hero".[24] Impressed, Rogers scheduled a second meeting with Rihanna's mother present and then invited Rihanna to his hometown in the United States to record some demo tapes that could be sent to record labels.[24] Recordings were intermittent, taking about a year because she was only able to record during school holidays. "Pon de Replay" and "The Last Time" were two tracks recorded for the demo tape, which were eventually included on her debut album Music of the Sun.[25] That same year, Rihanna was signed to Rogers's and Carl Sturken's production company, Syndicated Rhythm Productions.[24]</p>
      <p>Rihanna's demo was shipped out to Def Jam Recordings, where Jay Brown, an A&R executive at the record label, was one of the first to hear the demo. Brown played the demo tape for rapper Jay-Z, who had recently been appointed as president and CEO of Def Jam.[26] When Jay-Z first heard the track "Pon de Replay", he felt the song was too big for her.[27] Despite being skeptical, he invited Rihanna to audition for the label. In early 2005, Rihanna auditioned for Def Jam in New York City, where Jay-Z introduced her to music mogul Antonio "L.A." Reid.[24][28] At the audition, she sang Whitney Houston's cover of "For the Love of You", as well as the demo tracks "Pon de Replay" and "The Last Time".[24] Jay-Z was absolutely certain about signing her after she performed her future single "Pon de Replay".[27] His boss, L.A. Reid, was also impressed with her audition, telling Jay-Z not to let Rihanna leave the building until the contract was signed.[29] Reid left it to Jay-Z and his team to close the deal which resulted in a six-album record deal with Def Jam. She waited in Jay-Z's office until 3:00 in the morning to get lawyers to draft up a contract because he wanted to prevent her from signing with another label.[27] Rihanna canceled other meetings with record labels and relocated from Barbados to the United States to live with Rogers and his wife.[30]</p>

      <p>Rihanna has named Madonna as her idol and biggest influence. She said that she wanted to be the "black Madonna" and praised her ability to reinvent herself throughout her career.[195] She noted, "I think that Madonna was a great inspiration for me, especially on my earlier work. If I had to examine her evolution through time, I think she reinvented her clothing style and music with success every single time. And at the same time remained a real force in entertainment in the whole world."[195] Another major influence on Rihanna's music and career has been Mariah Carey, whose song "Hero" she performed when Rihanna was still a teenager at her high school talent show.[196] She revealed that Carey's song "Vision of Love" "was the song that made [her] want to do music.</p>
      <p>In her youth, she would see Bob Marley on television because of his fame in the Caribbean.[199] She stated, "He's one of my favourite artists of all time – he really paved the way for every other artist out of the Caribbean".[200] She built a shrine in her home dedicated to the reggae legend and has covered Marley's "Is This Love" and Bob Marley & The Wailers' "Redemption Song" during her concert tours.[201][202] During her childhood, she would go around singing Whitney Houston songs and "A Whole New World" into her hairbrush so much that her neighbors started calling her "Robyn Redbreast".[30] She also stated that one of the first songs she remembers falling in love with was Houston's version of "I Will Always Love You" and that it "was really inspiring, and it made me develop a passion for music, so really, she's partly responsible for me being here in this industry.</p>

      <p>Rihanna has worked with music video director Anthony Mandler on more than a dozen music videos, the first being "Unfaithful" (2006).[217] "We've done 16 videos together; they're not all tough, [...] Yeah, I mean, I'm known for the 'Disturbia's and the 'Russian Roulette's and things like that, but 'Only Girl (In the World)' is certainly an ethereal kind of empowering, beauty-filled video," Mandler said.[217] Jocelyn Vena of MTV wrote, "Rihanna, like Madonna, also has a tendency to make truly thought-provoking music videos that fit the songs they represent. Smattered in between glitzier, more glamorous clips, Madge and Ri want us to think about bigger issues".[193] Jon Bream of the Star Tribune commented "[i]n the tradition of Madonna and Janet Jackson, Rihanna has become the video vixen of the '00s ... Rihanna has perfected the pout, the long-legged strut, and trend-setting hairdos that keep women and men alike checking her out on YouTube."[218] George Epaminondas of InStyle considers Rihanna's music videos to be "cinematic" due to her "blend of lush island rhythms and swinging pop and ... mischievous sensuality </p>
      <p>Many of her music videos were shot as short films exploring issues such as love triangles, abuse and substance abuse romance, including "We Found Love" and "Man Down".[193] Her music video for "Umbrella" shows Rihanna's transition into adulthood and her newly adopted image.[220] The "dark, creepy" scenes of "Disturbia" have been compared to Michael Jackson's Thriller.[218][221] The video for "Russian Roulette" features Rihanna in a padded room playing a game of russian roulette with her partner. A scene of Rihanna being approached by a speeding car at night was compared to the altercation with Chris Brown.[222] In 2011, Rihanna released three controversial music videos about sadomasochism, rape and domestic violence.[223] "Man Down", which features Rihanna shooting a man in a train station, was criticized by the Parents Television Council.[224] "We Found Love", which shows Rihanna and her love interest in a drug-filled unhealthy relationship,[222] sparked criticism from the Rape Crisis Centre for its message.[225] Charne Graham of the Houston Press defended her, asking, "Why should Rihanna's music videos get everyone riled up when others' equally sexual and controversial videos are in rotation? [...] she just like[s] to make music videos that give us something to talk about."[223] Rihanna was the first woman to pass 2 billion cumulative views on the music video website Vevo.[226] As of December 2016, she has accumulated over 10 billion views on the site.</p>
